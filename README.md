# First-Order-Human-Detection-and-Extraction-from-two-Primsense-videos
This project facilitates the human detection and extraction tasks from videos collected by PrimeSense cameras with the supports of OpenGL, OpenNI, OpenCV. The deep informations, gathered from projecting the infrared rays of the cameras, are the useful features to detect and extract the human-being. The interesting points in this projects are to focus only on the person who has the nearest distance to the camera and extract her/him out of the background and to have the capacity of processing pararelly two videos. The people extracted from two videos are grouped together into a common screen. The purpose of this project is to simulate the online conference where the people from over the world can connect together with their PrimeSense camera.
