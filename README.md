# First-Order-Human-Detection-and-Extraction-from-two-Primsense-videos
This project facilitates the human detection and extraction tasks from videos collected by PrimeSense cameras with the supports of OpenGL, OpenNI, OpenCV. The deep informations, gathered from projecting the infrared rays of the cameras, are the useful features to detect and extract the human-being. The interesting points in this projects are to focus only on the person who has the nearest distance to the camera and extract her/him out of the background and to have the capacity of processing pararelly two videos. The people extracted from two videos are grouped together into a common screen. The purpose of this project is to simulate the online conference where the people from over the world can be connected together with their PrimeSense camera.

# The uploaded files on GitHub including:
- The setup file that you can install directly on your operating system. This version only supports the Window operating system.
- The main codes. For running these codes on Visual Studio, you need to install the OpenGL, OpenNI, OpenCV.
- The report that will help you to understand better on what I implemented in this project.
- To run this project, at first you must prepare your data. The data that I collected from Camera PrimSense under ONI format. If one of you dont have this kind of data, you can contact me at the mail address below vankhoa96pfiev@gmail.com.
